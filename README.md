## 🧠 Project Overview
This project evaluates **CyberSafe Ltd**, a mid-sized **financial technology company** in Lagos, Nigeria, specializing in digital payments and mobile wallet services across Africa.  
The goal was to perform a **compliance audit** and **gap analysis** to support ISO 27001 certification readiness, ensuring the organization meets key regulatory requirements and strengthens its security posture.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess CyberSafe Ltd’s **current ISMS (Information Security Management System)** against ISO 27001:2022 clauses.  
- Identify **strengths**, **gaps**, and **risk areas** impacting certification readiness.  
- Provide **actionable remediation strategies** and a **timeline** for achieving full compliance.  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Despite foundational controls such as **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, **SIEM logging**, and **anti-malware protection**, the organization faced:
- Potential failure in ISO 27001 certification audit  
- Gaps in GDPR, PCI DSS, and NDPR compliance  
- Reputational and trust risks from regulatory nonconformance  
- Insider threats and weak operational security culture  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
The assessment followed a **GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance)** audit framework aligned to ISO 27001 Annex A controls and the PDCA cycle:

1. **Review existing policies & evidence**
2. **Evaluate control maturity and compliance**
3. **Identify nonconformities (gaps)**
4. **Perform risk assessment (likelihood vs. impact)**
5. **Propose corrective & preventive actions**
6. **Develop compliance roadmap**

## 🔥 Risk Analysis Summary
| Risk Category | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Operational** | Shared admin credentials and poor patch management increase internal threat potential. |
| **Regulatory** | Non-alignment with GDPR, PCI DSS, and NDPR creates compliance exposure. |
| **Human** | Weak awareness and offboarding controls heighten insider threat risk. |
| **Technical** | Absence of removable media controls and mobile policy may lead to data exfiltration. |
